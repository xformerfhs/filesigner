I would like to thank the following people for their ideas and support:

- Florian Schäfer from DB Systel GmbH for his brilliant idea that the world becomes much simpler if you **don't** store the private key of a key pair.
- Arndt Schönewald from Quelltext AG for his patient help and great expertise in developing the user interface. 
- Filippo Valsorda for his great [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) program and the idea that you can do public key encryption without certificates.
